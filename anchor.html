        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Bhagalpur College of Engineering (B.C.E) Bhagalpur was set up by the Department Of Science and Technology
            Government of
            Bihar in the year 1960 with a view to providing efficient system of technical education in Bihar. Earlier
            the
            affiliation was under Tilkamanjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) Bhagalpur BIHAR which was later passed on to
            Aryabhatta
            Knowledge University (AKU) Patna which was established by the government of Bihar under Bihar Act 24 2008.
            BCE is
            administered by the Department of Science and Technology under the guidance of the government of Bihar.Since
            the
            inception of this seat of learning, it has moved ahead with the singular aim of training the students in the
            field of
            science and technology, not only the theoretical instructions scattered in hundreds of engineering books but
            also the
            pragmatic, down-to-earth practical solutions of the innumerable Engineering problems faced by the working
            technocrats in
            various Industries, R&D cells and Govt. departments. About 5000 Alumni, contributing to the cause of science
            and
            technology in India and abroad in many important capacities, speak of the glorious tradition of B.C.E the
            justification
            that quantity dulls the edge of quality and at least so the B.C.E.The institute offers full-time Bachelor of
            Technology
            (B.Tech) degree programs in disciplines of science and technology viz. Computer Science & Engineering,
            Electronics &
            Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering.
